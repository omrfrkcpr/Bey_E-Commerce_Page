-  User stories;

   - When I click plus button on product's row, I can increase the product's quantity.
   - When I click minus button on product's row, I can decrease the product's quantity, but minimum quantity value can be 1.
   - When I click remove button on product's row, I can delete a product in the cart.
   - When I change any combination of product chart(plus, minus, remove etc.), I want to see the new calculation of chart's prices in concerned fields.
